# Project Sprobo
Background:
>Growing up, I used to have a roller backpack that I would carry everywhere in school. For me, this backpack was optimized for ease in >getting items to and from pouches, efficient in moving around school, and less strain on the back. I realized that once I left elementary >school the stigma behind roller backpacks. So from that point onwards, I would lug around a typical backpack or satchel. 

Goal:
This project is a dream that I had since elementary school of creating a robot that would carry my backpack whereever I went. 

Requirements:
- Phase 1 requires two components: four wheeled backpack carrying robot tethered to computer
- Phase 2 requires two components: Handheld UI to control bcr
- Phase 3 requires one component: autonomously driving robot 
- Phase 4 requries one component: same as 3 but what if the robot is two wheeled

Timeline:
>Unknown at the moment (due to the scale of this project and the rather influx of ideas that I currently have, I will be posting >sproadically on updates for this project)
